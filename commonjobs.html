    <p>Babysitting on the side for family and friends is an easy way for teenagers to make money. However, teens make about 10-15 dollars per hour to totally care for children (usually kids that are especially young) for several hours at a time.</p>

    <p>The average wage for teenage retail jobs is $15/hr. That's fifteen dollars an hour to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Put up with some of the most annoying, needy, and abusive people out there</li>
      <li>Try to keep the store stocked and clean</li>
      <li>Learn and remember where everything in the store is, and know what is and is not in stock</li>
      <li>Be on their feet for several hours at a time with little rest</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you thought retail work was bad, the restaurant industry is even worse. The minumum wage for watiers is $2.13/hr, and the average pay is only $8. Their pay is supplemented with optional tips (of which people often do not leave any). They are subjected to an extremely high-stress environment between needing to have food out in time, have the order correct, and dealing with people even worse than retail workers do, all for even less money.</p>
