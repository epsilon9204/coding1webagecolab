    <h3>Asking for Raises</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to make more money at your job is to ask for it. While it may not be as applicable for part-time jobs, negotiation is a neccessary skill in salary jobs.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Know what a competitive salary is for your position</li>
      <li>Know your acomplishments within your time at the company</li>
      <li>Let your boss know how they can benefit</li>
      <li>Provide your request in writing</li>
      <li>Be confident!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Quiet Quitting</h3>
    <p>Quiet quitting is the bane of employers-- it's when you don't put any more effort into your job than you need to. It can be used as a leverage tool to negotiate higher salaries, however employers can also get on to you for not pulling your weight. It's important to know the line between not doing enough work and doing more than you need to, so you don't put too many expectations into your work.</p>
    
    <h3>Unions</h3>
    <p>Unionizing is the one of the best things you can do as an employee. Unions ensure you get things like decent raises, a stable schedule, and a better work environment. You can look into local labor unions and get into contact with union advisors for help on joining a union or finding a union job.</p>
