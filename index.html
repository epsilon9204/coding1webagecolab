    <h3> Only <span class="emph">50%</span> of teens have a bank account</h3>
    <p>In fact, most teens have little-to-no knowledge about banking, investments, or the stock market. This lack of knowledge about the economy is crippling our new generation.</p>

    <h3> Why do teens need more money?</h3>
    <p>However, teens aren't living on the money they make from their job, since they still are living with their parents. However that's no guerantee they don't pay rent or utilities, paid for their own car, pay for their own gas, or pay for their own insurance. On top of all of that, they need to be saving money for a possible college fund, their future housing, and any emergencies that may occur. Not only that, but teens these days don't know how to manage their money, because they never get any of it!</p>
